# AnkiSyncDuolingo
Pull words you've learned from Duolingo into Anki 2.1.50+

ðŸ”´ **NOTICE**: Because of recent changes by Duolingo, this plugin is now **unstable** and you may encounter problems when trying to log into Duolingo. Follow https://github.com/JASchilz/AnkiSyncDuolingo/issues/64 for more information. ðŸ”´

## Installing

### Manually

To install manually, download `duolingo_sync.ankiaddon` from the [latest release](https://github.com/JASchilz/AnkiSyncDuolingo/releases/latest/). You can then use Anki's `Tools` -> `Add-ons` -> `Install from file...` and select the `duolingo_sync.ankiaddon` file to install this plugin.

### From the Anki Add-on Repository

In Anki, select `Tools` -> `Add-ons` -> `Get Add-ons` and then enter the code from the bottom of this addo-on's [Anki Add-On Repository page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/557761805)

## Use

### Select Your Language in Duolingo

The `Pull from Duolingo` plugin will download words from your *active* Duolingo language: whatever language you have most recently selected for learning. You can change your active language using the Duolingo mobile app or web application:

### Pull from Duolingo

After installing the addon and restarting Anki, you can now select the `Pull from Duolingo` dialog from the `Tools` menu in Anki.

If it's your first time using the addon, `Pull from Duolingo` will ask your permission to create its custom note type.

`Pull from Duolingo` will then ask you to log in to Duolingo. The addon will only sync in Duolingo words that you've already learned. **This add-on will only pull in words that you've already learned**. As you learn more words in Duolingo, use this add-on again to pull those words in Anki.

### Translations

This plugin does not provide translations: it only provides the words you've learned in the language that you're learning. This is because Duolingo does not make translations available to applications like this plugin. So after importing your cards, on your first review you'll need to provide the translation for the cards that you've imported.

Alternately, [some users have shared work flows for bulk translating the cards from this plugin using external services like Google Translate](https://github.com/JASchilz/AnkiSyncDuolingo/issues/61).

### Managing Notes

`Duolingo Sync` will create cards into your `Default` deck. It will include helpful tags--including `duolingo_sync` and the name of the language--that you can use to sort your cards. Once these cards are created, you're welcome to move them into other decks or add additional tags.

### Editing Notes

By all means, edit the notes to your liking after they are imported into Anki. For example, you may wish to replace the text from your native-language with an image or images.

Depending on the language you are studying, these notes may have helpful `{{ gender }}` or `{{ pronunciation }}` fields. You can browse your notes to see if this information is included, and add it to your cards if you like. For example, adding `{{ pronunciation }}` might be helpful if you're studying a language like Chinese with a non-Latin script.

The only editing you _can't_ do is changing the `Gid` attribute or removing the `duolingo_sync` tag: the addon uses these to uniquely identify words from Duolingo and avoid importing a words into multiple notes.

## Etc.
